# Telecom Market Entry Analysis

This project presents a data-driven market entry strategy for launching eSIM services across three emerging markets: **Thailand**, **Mexico**, and **South Africa**. It combines infrastructure and affordability metrics with sentiment analysis to produce a ranked market recommendation, supported by a Power BI dashboard and a report.

## ðŸ§  Objective
Identify the most promising country for an eSIM market launch based on:
- Network infrastructure quality
- Mobile data affordability
- Customer sentiment toward telecom operators

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development, KPI design, data visualization
- **Python**: Sentiment analysis using VADER
- **Power Query & DAX**: Data cleaning, transformation, and calculated columns
- **Web Scraping**: Manual Python script-based scraping and extraction of reviews from Trustpilot, HelloPeter, and Reddit

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features
The interactive Power BI dashboard presents:
- Market comparison by download/upload speed, latency, and tower density

## ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis
Over **280 user reviews** were scraped and analyzed using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning).  
Key insights include:
- **Mexico** had the lowest satisfaction (81.4% negative reviews)
- **Thailand** showed strong infrastructure but poor sentiment
- **South Africa** had the most balanced sentiment but lower affordability

## ðŸ§¾ Summary of Findings
- **Recommended Launch Market**: **Thailand**  
  Best balance of affordability and infrastructure, despite sentiment challenges.
- **Second Phase**: **Mexico**  
  Adequate technical foundation, but requires service differentiation due to poor sentiment.
- **Monitor**: **South Africa**  
  Strong download speeds, but affordability barriers limit mass adoption.
